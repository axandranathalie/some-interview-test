# 🎨 Trend Explorer UI – Frontend Assignment

Welcome! This take-home assignment is designed to evaluate your frontend development skills with React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript using a real-world data source.

Your task is to build a clean and responsive user interface that fetches blog posts from a public WordPress API and displays them in a user-friendly way.

## 📌 Goal

Create a frontend UI in Next.js that fetches and displays blog posts from:

https://bergvik.se/wp-json/wp/v2/posts

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to work with APIs, design interfaces using TailwindCSS, and create reusable, well-structured components.

## ✅ Requirements

### 1. Fetch and Display Posts

- On page load, fetch posts from the API
- For each post, display:
  - Title
  - Excerpt (short summary)
  - Link to the original post
  - Publish date (formatted clearly)

### 2. Search Functionality

- When the user types, filter visible posts based on whether the keyword appears in the title or excerpt (case-insensitive)

### 3. UI and Styling

- Use **TailwindCSS** for layout and styling
- Ensure the UI is responsive and looks good on desktop and mobile
- Design should be clean, readable, and user-friendly

### 4. Error and Loading States

- Display a user-friendly message if the fetch fails or returns no results
